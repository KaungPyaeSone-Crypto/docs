# Currencies

In Uphold's API, we frequently call for a currency as an input or output. We represent all such currencies and stores of value by an abbreviation code of variable length, typically containing uppercase letters (for example a currency's [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) code, an asset's [ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol), or other similar well-known representation).

You can obtain an up-to-date list of the currencies we support, along with the corresponding abbreviation codes, from the output of a [reserve status](#reserve-status) API call, or by visiting our [Transparency page](https://uphold.com/en/transparency).
